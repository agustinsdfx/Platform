### 📖 ABOUT

Platform is an open-source game engine that allows you to customize the source code and port it to different platforms using CMake, with the platform's graphics library and the C programming language.

### ⚙ Supported Systems

- Linux x64 platforms

### 📦 Instructions

#### How to build and compile it

To build and compile it, simply open the Compile.sh file.

### 🗿 Developer Notes

We use the [Tags](https://github.com/agustinsdfx/Platform/tags) section to list all versions; older versions are replaced by newer ones and become obsolete and cannot be downloaded again.

We added a flag that represents Venezuela; this is not a mockery, it is a symbol because Venezuela is free after a long time, and it is also in honor of the people who did not survive or left the country.

To compile, the following libraries are needed:

- Raylib 5.5

- SDL3.4.0
