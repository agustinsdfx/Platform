# WARN.md

This code file is a very early version of Platform LAN's development, but I couldn't finish it because I understood very little of it. I tried using AI agents to understand it and copy code snippets, which ended up in this file.

I'm leaving it here for you to improve and create your own version, better and more stable than this mess.
